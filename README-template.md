### What I learned

I learned during this small qr app development how to get QR codes from specific websites on Chrome. I also learned how to take screenshots with (cntrl + shft + p) in chrome developer tools.

### Continued development

I still don't feel completely comfortable with how I organize my files, and I am not completely solid in my understanding of every aspect of github. I do not know how to use git, but I use the desktop version because it has a good UI.
